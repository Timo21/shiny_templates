# Single tab dashboard
Sometimes you do want some features of the shiny dahsboard (like the header and sidebar menu). But plan on using a single tab.
This template then starts off with the sidebar closed and removes the tab in the sidebar with some javascript.
Also compared to the multitab template it does not use a `ui_tabs` folder.
